# MarketingAnalyticsProject
Context: Assuming that I've been told by the Chief Marketing Officer that recent marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be. I need to analyze the data set to understand this problem and figure out useful insights.
1. Assessing and Cleaning data
- Checking null values
- Checking datatype (change data type if necessary)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Are there any outliers? How will you wrangle/handle them?
- Are there any useful variables that you can engineer with the given data?
Do you notice any patterns or anomalies in the data? Can you plot them?
3. Statistical Analysis
- What factors are significantly related to the number of store purchases?
- Fish has Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for the brain. - Accordingly, do "Married PhD candidates" have a significant relation with amount spent on fish?
4. Further Analysis
- Which marketing campaign is most successful?
- What does the average customer look like for this company? Which products are performing best?
- Which channels are underperforming?
